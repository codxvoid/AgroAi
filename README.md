##  Overview

**AgroAi** is an intelligent multi-agent system designed to empower modern agriculture using real-time and inferred data across diverse domains:

-  **Geolocation & Weather Integration**  
-  **Temperature & Climate Impact Modeling**  
-  **Chemical Usage Tracking** with Human Health Impact Analysis  
-  **Crop Suitability & Productivity Forecasting**  
-  **Terminal / CLI-based AI Query System**

Powered by AI agents (e.g., Gemini, Google Earth API integration), AgroAI doesn't just answer — it **predicts, explains, and advises**.

---

##  Use Case

> “What crop is best for this district this month, considering current weather, past yield, and fertilizer usage?”

**AgroAi** will:
- Analyze location & climate
- Infer soil condition based on geography
- Track past chemical inputs (manual or database-fed)
- Evaluate crop impact on **human health** due to residuals
- Suggest ideal crops with **reasoning**

##  Status

- Core agent planning:   
- Data integration module:   
- CLI interface:   
- Deployment-ready MVP:
